            You can write fast, modern, responsive web applications by generating your HTML on the server, and
            delivering
            that (with a little help) directly to the browser. You don’t need JSON as an in-between format. You
            don’t
            need
            client-side MVC frameworks. You don’t need complicated bundling and transpiling pipelines. But you do
            need
            to
            think different.

            Because the mainstream story in web development of the past decade or so has been one of JavaScript all
            the
            things! Let’s use it on the server! Let’s use it on the client! Let’s have it generate all the HTML
            dynamically!
            And, really, it’s pretty amazing that you really can do all that. JavaScript has come an incredibly long
            way
            since the dark ages of Internet Explorer’s stagnant monopoly.

            But incidental complexity can absolutely break your back if you’re a small team where everyone has to do
            a
            lot.
            The tools and techniques forged in the belly of a huge company is often the exact opposite of what you
            need
            to
            make progress at your scale.
